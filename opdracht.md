## Exercise

- Build a working application using Java (or Kotlin) and frameworks of your choosing
- Make small commits so we can see the thought process
- Add automated tests
- Share your code via a source repository

## Short description

You work at a startup that wants to create a bank for crypto currency.
Users have to be able to make deposits to their account. When deposits are made, an external api needs to be checked for the current value. Amounts can be stored for now as USD. Only deposits smaller than 200 Dollar can be done.

A free API like [https://docs.coincap.io/](https://docs.coincap.io/) can be used to look up the value of the Crypto currency.

Make sure the value of the Currency is recorded at the moment of the deposit.

Spend around 2 hours on it and share the source repository link so we can review it together.
